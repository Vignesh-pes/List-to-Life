Walmart List-to-Life AI Assistant
Reimagining the Customer Shopping Experience

üí° Project Idea: One-Line Summary
The Walmart List-to-Life AI Assistant reimagines shopping. It's an AI-powered companion providing smart lists, real-time stock/deals, optimized in-store navigation, and personalized recommendations for a seamless, proactive customer experience.

üéØ The Problem We're Solving
The modern shopping experience is often fragmented, inefficient, and impersonal. Customers face challenges such as:

Inefficient Planning: Manually creating shopping lists that don't adapt to real-time store conditions (e.g., knowing if an item is in stock).

Wasted Time & Frustration: Discovering out-of-stock items only after arriving at the store, leading to aimless wandering or missed purchases.

Missed Savings: Lack of proactive information about personalized deals, coupons, and budget optimization.

Disconnected Journeys: A disconnect between online planning and the physical in-store experience, with no intelligent guidance for navigation.

Lack of Personalization: Generic shopping experiences that don't leverage individual purchase history for relevant suggestions.

üöÄ Our Solution: A Unified, Intelligent Shopping Companion
Our project tackles these problems by creating a comprehensive AI Assistant that guides the customer through their entire shopping journey, making it proactive, personalized, and efficient. This is achieved through a modular, dual-component architecture.

Key Features & Solutions Implemented:
AI-Powered List Generation:

Problem Solved: Manual, static list creation.

Solution: An intelligent AI (powered by Google Gemini) understands natural language concepts (e.g., "Create a list for a BBQ party") and generates comprehensive, relevant shopping lists.

Real-time Stock & Smart Substitute Engine:

Problem Solved: Out-of-stock frustration and wasted trips.

Solution: Proactively checks live store inventory for every item on the list. If an item is out of stock or low on stock, the AI immediately alerts the user and suggests the best available alternative from the catalog, complete with reasoning.

Personalized Deal & Budget Optimizer:

Problem Solved: Missed savings and budget overruns.

Solution: Automatically identifies and applies all relevant deals and promotions to the shopping list, calculating real-time totals and helping users stay within their budget.

Optimized In-Store Navigator:

Problem Solved: Inefficient store navigation and wasted time.

Solution: Calculates the most efficient walking path through a simulated Walmart store for the items on the user's list, providing step-by-step guidance.

Personalized Recommendation Engine:

Problem Solved: Generic shopping experiences and missed opportunities for upselling/cross-selling.

Solution: Analyzes historical customer purchase data to generate "Frequently Bought Together" recommendations, anticipating customer needs and suggesting relevant additional items.

üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture
The project is built with a modular, dual-stack approach, ensuring clear separation of concerns, reusability, and scalability.

Backend (Python Flask API):

The core intelligence and business logic reside in a Python Flask application, acting as a dedicated API server.

It orchestrates all functionalities by importing and utilizing specialized Python modules:

stock_engine.py: Manages product catalog, inventory status, and substitution logic.

deal_optimizer.py: Handles loading deals and applying discounts to shopping lists.

store_navigator.py: Implements graph algorithms for route optimization based on store layout.

recommendation_engine.py: Processes customer purchase history to generate recommendations.

Communicates with the frontend via RESTful API endpoints and uses Flask Sessions for conversational memory.

Leverages Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash) for natural language understanding, list generation, and conversational responses, guided by advanced prompt engineering.

Frontend (React/TypeScript - Conceptual Integration):

(Note: While the provided files include a React frontend structure, this Flask project is designed to serve as its backend API. The React frontend would consume the Flask API endpoints for dynamic data and AI interaction.)

Built with React and TypeScript for a modern, component-based UI.

Styled using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI components for a clean, responsive, and attractive design.

Data Layer (Local JSON Files):

All product, inventory, substitution, deal, customer purchase, and store layout data is managed locally using JSON files. These files are generated and kept consistent by dedicated Python scripts (generate_data.py, create_deals_json.py).

(Future Enhancement: This could be migrated to a cloud database like Supabase for persistent, scalable data storage.)

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
AI/ML: Google Gemini (Generative AI - gemini-1.5-flash), Prompt Engineering, Conversational AI, Association Rule Mining (for FBT).

Backend: Python 3.x, Flask, Flask-CORS, python-dotenv.

Data Handling: JSON, Faker (for synthetic data generation), collections.defaultdict, math.

Algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Nearest Neighbor (for path optimization).

Frontend (for full vision): React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI.

üöÄ Setup & Installation (Backend)
Follow these steps to get the Flask backend running:

Clone the Repository:

git clone <YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER_NAME> # e.g., cd list-to-life-retail-ai-main
cd backend                   # Navigate into the backend directory

Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

Install Dependencies:

pip install Flask google-generativeai python-dotenv Faker

Get Google Gemini API Key:

Go to Google AI Studio and create an API key.

Configure Environment Variables:

In the backend directory, create a file named .env.

Add your Gemini API key to this file:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

üèÉ How to Run the Project
Generate Data Files:

Ensure you are in the backend directory in your terminal.

Run the data generation script:

python generate_data.py

This will create products.json, inventory.json, substitutions.json, customer_purchases.json, and store_layout.json.

Generate Deals Data:

Still in the backend directory, run the deals generation script:

python create_deals_json.py

This will create deals.json.

Update app.py with Fresh Product Names:

Open your newly generated products.json file.

Copy 4-5 product_name values exactly as they appear (e.g., "ShinePro Laundry Detergent (100 Loads)", "FarmFresh Milk (Gallon)").

Open your app.py file.

Locate the DEFAULT_SHOPPING_LIST_NAMES list (around line 70). Replace the example names in that list with the EXACT product_names you just copied.

Save app.py.

Start the Flask Application:

In your terminal (still in the backend directory), run:

python app.py

You should see messages confirming modules loaded successfully and Gemini initialized.

Access the Web Interface:

Open your web browser (preferably Chrome for voice features) and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

üé¨ Demo & Usage
Interact with the chatbot to showcase its features.

Initial Page Load:

Observe the default shopping list displaying with correct product names, prices, stock statuses, and any substitutes/deals applied. The "Estimated Total" and "Total Discount" should be visible. The "Optimized In-Store Path" should also show a generated path.

AI-Powered List Generation & Proactive Stock Check:

Prompt: Create a shopping list for a vegetarian BBQ

Observe: The AI generates a list. If any items are out of stock (verify in inventory.json), the AI will proactively mention it in the chat and suggest a substitute. The list on the page updates with stock/substitute info.

List Modification & Deal Optimization:

Prompt: Add 2 [Product Name from your products.json that qualifies for a deal, e.g., "ShinePro Laundry Detergent (100 Loads)"] to my list

Observe: The item is added. The "Total Discount" and "Final Total" update automatically, reflecting any applied deals.

Prompt: Remove [Product Name from your current list]

Observe: The item is removed, and totals update.

Optimized In-Store Navigation:

Prompt: What's the best route in the store for my list?

Observe: The AI responds conversationally, and the "Optimized In-Store Path" section updates with a detailed route.

Personalized Recommendations:

Prompt: What do other customers usually buy with these items?

Observe: The AI suggests items based on "Frequently Bought Together" rules from customer_purchases.json.

Voice Interaction:

Click the microphone icon and speak your prompts.

Observe: Your speech is transcribed, and the AI responds both in text and audibly.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Migrate local JSON data to a robust cloud database (e.g., Supabase, PostgreSQL) for persistence, scalability, and multi-user support.

Advanced Personalization: Implement more sophisticated machine learning models for personalized recommendations (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) based on individual user profiles and purchase history.

Real-time Route Updates: Dynamically update the in-store path if items are picked up, or if the user deviates from the route (requires location tracking simulation).

Frontend Integration: Fully integrate this Flask backend with a sophisticated React/TypeScript frontend for a truly seamless user experience.

User Authentication: Implement user login/signup to personalize experiences across sessions.

Consumables Tracking: Proactively remind users when they might be running low on frequently purchased consumable items.
